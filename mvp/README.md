## ⚙️ Configuration

Kratai stores settings in `.vscode/kratai.json` in your workspace:

- **Folders to scan** — Specify which source directories to include
- **File extensions** — Select languages: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.php`
- **Class type filters** — Show/hide interfaces, modules, classes
- **Relationship type filters** — Show/hide inheritance, usage, implementation
- **Git diff base commit** — Defaults to `HEAD~1`, customize for other comparisons

---

## 📋 Requirements

- VS Code 1.120.0 or higher
- A code project with supported languages
- Git repository (optional, for diff highlighting)

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Very large codebases (1000+ classes) may render slowly
