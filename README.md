## ⚙️ Configuration

Kratai stores settings in `.vscode/kratai.json` in your workspace:

- **Folders to scan** — Root folder selected by default; customize to include only specific directories
- **File extensions** — Select languages: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.php`
- **Class type filters** — Show/hide interfaces, modules, classes
- **Relationship type filters** — Show/hide inheritance, usage, implementation
- **Git diff highlighting** — Toggle on/off to show uncommitted changes

**First-Time Setup:** On your first diagram generation, Kratai opens the configuration panel with the root folder pre-selected. You can adjust settings and click "Save & Generate Diagram" to proceed.
